# FlappInverse
My take on Flappy Bird.

The game was created by me as a warm up exrcise in the _Gaming Lab_ course as part of the _Bezalel Game Development and Design Minor_ of my _Computer Science B.Sc._ in _The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel_.

To run the game om Android run the FlappInverse.apk file on your android device to install. Than run the FlappInverse app.

To run the game on Windows run the _Windows Build/FlappInverse.exe_ executable file.

To run the game on Mac run the  _Mac Build.app_ package.
