An inverted take on Flappy Bird.

Keep the squares from touching the columns of their color while keeping an eye for the color switching of the squares.

The game was created by me as a warm up exrcise in the _Gaming Lab_ course as part of the _Bezalel Game Development and Design Minor_ of my _Computer Science B.Sc._ in _The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel_.
